On 26th January, 2019 we did our first trip with a biker's group from Bhubaneswar, called Creed Bulls.The best about the trip for us was that we got to ride with them. Since it was our first time conducting a trip ever, we were very nervous. But the guys were very cool and patient as we tried to juggle so much work and serve them. From setting up the tents to barbecuing and from getting the bonfire going to making dinner, all of them pitched in and helped.As they say, first time is always special.",

He wanted to camp with his friends. We immediately made all the arrangements and were off to camping. The best part about this camp was the honest and constructive feedback we got about what can be done to make it better and more fun for the customers. It will remain an important trip for us forever because we got to learn so much.",

It is the site of the largest wintering ground for migratory birds on the Indian Sub-continent and hence of great importance to the state tourism. It has many small and large islands which makes it perfect for camping along with bird watching and dolphin sightings.This was our second trip with the members of Creed Bulls albeit in a different location.But the experience with them remained the same.

We reached Chandrabhaga early and set up the tents while they rode their cycles from Bhubaneswar to Chandrabhaga and joined us later at night.It was an amazing experience interacting with them and learning about the benefits of cycling, both physical and environmental. We are even contemplating joining their group. We also had a mini Holi celebration in the morning.",

The boat rides, the islands, the birds, the dolphins and the marine life. You camp literally in no man's land, between the lake and the sea. For a night you are the only people on the Island. Just few friends chilling and having a good time with no one to bother them. What else could one ask for?",

Ghastly winds started blowing around that time and lasted till 6 in the morning. We couldn't sleep the whole night. Screaming waves, black sky, thunderstorm and our tent completely bent down on us. We would routinely peek our head out of our tent to see if the people were okay, if the tents were okay and if its gonna rain. But, thankfully it didn't rain and we had one less thing to worry about. Somehow we passed the night and emerged victorious the next day. It really did make up for an awesome experience.",
